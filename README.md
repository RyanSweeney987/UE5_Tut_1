# Unreal Engine 5 - Draw debug strings in editor mode

This project contains the files created for the tutorial found here: https://youtu.be/FQQmdirfVYg

The only files you actually need are DebugStrings.h and DebugStrings.cpp\
These are found in Source > UE5_Tut_1\
Just add the component to an actor and enable the view flag and away you go
